Fake Store homework for React Class

These are my notes on doing this homework. The notes include items not clear in the code itself, including what I have done with GitHub and Terminal, such as cloning and loading npm, react, etc.

## GitHub Setup

I created a new repository on GitHub, with the following specifications:

- No Template
- Name: truthy-falsy-store
- Description: Fake Store homework for React Class
- Public
- Add a README file

The name cannot contain upper case letters, to comply with something I don't remember. It may be a requirement of React.

The README file is added so that the repository is not empty. This is needed so that the clone function will work correctly.

## Cloning the Repo

I used VSCode to clone the repo. I used the HTPPS connection.

After cloning, I renamed README.md as MyNotes.md and used it for these notes. The React installation will create a new README.md file.

## Installing React

At the terminal:
npx create-react-app truthy-falsy-store
npm install react-router-dom


Note: "npm install" will use the package.json file and install all dependencies required. This is useful when cloning someone else's application from GitHub, where the dependencies are not included.
